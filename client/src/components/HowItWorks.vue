                    Using FRiENDs is an extremely simple task, the only tool you’ll need to use is our search prompt. You really did enjoy a movie and now want similar options to watch? Just type its name at the prompt. You simply love an actor/actress, wish to see more of his/her work? Type their name at the prompt. You like a particular genre, but have no ideas in mind? That’s no bummer, you know what to do by now ;)
For all of this options, FRiENDs will provide a list of movies perfect for your entertainment.
